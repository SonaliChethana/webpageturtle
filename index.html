        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p><i>Today there are 250 species of turtles on earth. Seven of these live in the ocean and are called sea turtles. 
            The remaining 243 species live on land or in freshwater ponds and marshes. 
            The terrestrial turtles, those that live solely on land, are called tortoises.
            Turtles are rarely seen because the sea is their habitat and only the females come ashore and that too only after dark.
            The land turtles and land tortoises are also seen in frequently.

                      <h3>Nature of the Turtles</h3>
                        <img id="subImg"  src="images/eggs.jpg"  width="400px" height="300px" >
                        <p> The shells of the turtles and tortoises differ. The Carapace or top part of the shell of the turtles is streamlined and short making swimming easy.
                            On the other hand the shell of the tortoise is thick and more useful for their protection.
                          The plastron or under shell of the two species differ in the same manner.
                          The leathery turtle has a thick leathery skin instead of the bony shell. Turtles have broad, flattened flippers whilst tortoises have short cylindrical limbs. 
                          The flippers facilitate swimming greatly but make it very difficult for females to move on the beaches where they come back to nest.
                        </p>
                         <p>
                          The males once they get into the sea, as hatchlings never come ashore though the females come back to the same beaches to lay their eggs. 
                          Mature females after mating at sea come ashore to lay their eggs. The female moves as far up the beach as possible to lay her eggs. 
                          This is to ensure that the water coming up with the tide does not reach the eggs and spoil them. Once ashore the female labours up the beach to a spot it chooses.
                          Then after turning and facing the sea, proceeds to dig a shallow depression in the sand with its flippers. Once the pit is dug a cylindrical egg chamber is dug, under her posterior end, also with its flippers.
                          The egg chamber is about 18 to 20 inches depending on the length of her flippers. 
                          Around 75 to 130 soft-shelled, ping-pong ball shaped eggs are laid.

                      <h3>Turtle lifespan</h3>
                                  <img  id="subImg"  src="images/lifespan.jpg" width="400px"  height="300px">

                                      The average lifespan of a turtle or tortoise is highly dependent on the species. Some species may only live 10 to 20 years in captivity, while others can live up to 150 years.
                                      In general, most turtle and tortoise species can live well into their 50s if provided appropriate care.Most turtles and tortoises should ideally live much longer in captivity than in the wild. However, when kept as pets, turtles and tortoises are typically difficult to care for.
                                      Aquatic turtles will commonly live 20-30 years in captivity, but many can live much longer. Tortoises are more well-known for their longevity-with some estimated to live 100 to 150 years. 
                                      Below are some commonly kept turtle and tortoise species and their approximate lifespans:
                                      <ul>
                                        <li> Leopard tortoise: 100 years or more</li>
                                        <li>Box turtle: 20-50 years </li> 
                                        <li>Greek tortoise: 100 years or more</li>
                                        <li>Map turtle: 15-25 years</li>
                                    </ul>

                      <h3>Specialties of Turtles</h3>

                      <p>Scientists believe loggerheads detect magnetic fields and react to that information. The intensity results from the fact that the field lines emerge from the southern pole of the Earth, wrap around the planet, and re-enter in the northern half. 
                           Research on sea turtles suggest these animals possess a type of compass that enable them to detect both the direction and strength of the earth's magnetic field, and this allows them to determine their location.
                        </p>
                        <p>    
                          Recently scientists have shown how loggerheads detect magnetic fields and react to that information. Other studies on hatchling loggerheads have shown that even one-day-old newborns detect magnetic inclination angle as well as field intensity to navigate their way across the world.
                          If the inclination angle is too steep, the turtle knows that it is too far north and therefore needs to travel south to reach home.</p>
