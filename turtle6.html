        <h2>Introduction</h2>
         <p>Isn`t life all about the little things that take up all your heart? Well, it definitely is, for the good folks at the Kosgoda Turtle Hatchery. Here`s a welfare center that genuinely cares about these little creatures, even before they`re born.
            Today, six out of the seven species of sea turtles are endangered. They start with keeping an eye on the nesting mother turtles, bringing their eggs to the secure environment of the hatchery and finally releasing the baby turtles into the sea on the day of their birth.
            Kosgoda is the one of the very few hatcheries where all the five species in the country make their nests. They are the Olive Ridleys, Leatherbacks, Green Turtles, Loggerheads and Hawksbills.

             <h3>Importance of turtles</h3>
            <p>Coral reefs are home to Hawksbills, which specialise in eating a handful of species of sea sponges. This diet allows less common types of sponges to grow, which increases the variety of life on the reef. 
            Without Hawksbills, sponges can overgrow and suffocate slow-growing corals causing them to die.</p>
        <br>
        <p>          
            Sea turtles also have a positive influence on water. Nesting sea turtles help beaches by depositing their eggs in the sand. Eggshells and unhatched eggs left behind provide important nutrients that nourish dune vegetation such as beach grasses, which stabilise dunes and help to prevent coastal erosion.
            Sea turtles play an important cultural role for many coastal communities around the world. They are also an important source of income for coastal residents through turtle-watching ecotourism which is a major and an increasingly popular part of Sri Lanka tourism.
            They are a source of awe and inspiration; watching them haul themselves up a beach to nest, swim through a reef, or watch hatchlings charge to the sea, are truly magical and unforgettable experiences.
